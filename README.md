# C11A_Exceptions
In this exercise we'll create a very simple bank account class that throws an exception. In order to focus on exception mechanics, our bank account will contain a minimal set of fields/methods. We will also have a custom exception class and a "driver" class (ATM) that contains main. To keep this simple, the ATM class will hardcode withdrawal amounts, as described below.
