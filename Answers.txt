1) Why is BigDecimal better than double for representing dollar amounts?

BigDecimal is better than double because BigDecimal is an exact way to represent numbers, while double can sometimes drop vaules when doing math
with numbers on very separate magnitudes. Example 10,000 + .0001. If you use doubles the result may just drop the .0001. BigDecimal will not drop
the .0001 when adding them together.

Do not created new custom exceptions if they don't provide useful information to the user
Include your exceptions in your Javadoc summaries
Log exceptions into the stack just once to debugging and troubleshooting them isn't confusing
